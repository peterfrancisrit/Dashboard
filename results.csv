This beautiful lot benefits not just from the amazing terroir of Intibuca, but also from careful processing. The profile in the cup displays a great range of flavours: fresh grape, chocolate, and sweet butter cookies, with a structured acidity.</p>

Located on the Colombian Massif, El Marcelo benefits from an incredibly high altitude. This means that the cherries have the advantage of ripening more slowly, developing great sweetness and complexity over time. We were blown away with the pre-shipment samples for this coffee, and the beans are even more expressive now that they landed at the roastery. We are getting juicy flavours of cranberry, blueberry and sweet apple with assam tea and hibscus floral notes.<br> <br> The coffee cherries at El Marcelo are hand picked when they have ripened to a deep purple colour, then sorted meticulously for any defects or underripes. The coffees are set to rest in their cherries for a day after picking, allowing them to absorb some extra sweetness and retain more of the cherry's natural characteristics. Afterwards, the seeds are depulped and fermented underwater for 24 hours before being washed and slowly dried on raised beds under a shade cover. This careful procedure ensures crystal clear flavours in the cup.</p>",Filter Coffee,Beans,Filter,Origin: South America,1

This makes low-caffeine varietals extremely hard to grow. We are offering microlots from two fantastic coffee plants across a year: Laurina or Aramosa. Both naturally contain only 0.3-0.7% caffeine (regular Arabica coffee has up to 1.8%). <br><br>A Low Caf Subscription from us is the best way to stay fully stocked with freshly roasted beans every month.

Located on the Colombian Massif, El Marcelo benefits from an incredibly high altitude. This means that the cherries have the advantage of ripening more slowly, developing great sweetness and complexity over time. We were blown away with the pre-shipment samples for this coffee, and the beans are even more expressive now that they landed at the roastery. We are getting juicy flavours of cranberry, blueberry and sweet apple with assam tea and hibscus floral notes.<br> <br> The coffee cherries at El Marcelo are hand picked when they have ripened to a deep purple colour, then sorted meticulously for any defects or underripes. The coffees are set to rest in their cherries for a day after picking, allowing them to absorb some extra sweetness and retain more of the cherry's natural characteristics. Afterwards, the seeds are depulped and fermented underwater for 24 hours before being washed and slowly dried on raised beds under a shade cover. This careful procedure ensures crystal clear flavours in the cup.</p>",Filter Coffee,Beans,Filter,Origin: South America,1

This makes low-caffeine varietals extremely hard to grow. We are offering microlots from two fantastic coffee plants across a year: Laurina or Aramosa. Both naturally contain only 0.3-0.7% caffeine (regular Arabica coffee has up to 1.8%). <br><br>A Low Caf Subscription from us is the best way to stay fully stocked with freshly roasted beans every month.

<p class=""layoutArea"">Uraga is one of several sorting stations operated by Israel Degfa in Ethiopia’s Guji Region. Guji coffees are known for their distinct flavor profiles, and the Uragas met our expectations - and then some, being a real standout this year. The Uraga washing station works closely with producers and producer groups in order to access the best cherries in the region. The station’s staff does the sorting and grading on-site and invests in improving processing and drying systems throughout the region.</p>

</div>
<div>
<br>Eugenoides, together with Robusta, are the parents of Arabica. We’ve found Eugenoides to have insanely high sweetness companied with lower acidity and bitterness thankfully to the naturally low content of caffeine.<br>The concept of this farm tries to reconstruct a natural ecosystem for these coffee plants. The crops are very well organised between each other to allow the plants to grow and expand more naturally. They also plant Acacia, Lemongrass, and Guabo trees to produce more nitrogen which the coffee plants breath to produce exceptional seed cherry with a high level of sugars.<br>To further control the drying, coffee goes into a special greenhouse with an internal dehumidifier. The dehumidifier allows to slow down the drying process to provide more time for the sugars to transfer into the bean. This helps to produce an even sweeter coffee with higher clarity in the flavor.</div>

The parchment is soaked for 24-36 hours before it is graded in washing channels into two grades and then soaked again for 12-24 hours.  The coffee is then dried on African elevated drying beds for 10-15 days. Parchment is continuously sorted during drying to eliminate defects. The coffee is shipped and stored in vacuum packed boxes.<br><b>Flavor Description:</b> <meta charset=""utf-8"">

<span><span>Idido is a cooperative in the village of Idido, close to the the town of Yirgacheffe in the Gedeo zone of southern Ethiopia. The Idido cooperative and its more than 1000 members are part of the Yirgacheffe Farmers Cooperative. The Idido cooperative works with growers from neighbouring villages </span><span>Aricha, Direto, Ela Tenecha, Gersse, Bowicha, H Badmie, Charbanita and Idido itself, where the centralized wet mill is located. The growers take their cherries here after the day’s harvest for processing. This natural processed coffee from Idido was dried in thin layers on raised drying beds. To avoid over-fermentation and mold, the cherries are turned every 3 hours in the first few days. Depending on weather conditions, 5-6 weeks later the beans are hulled.</span></span>
